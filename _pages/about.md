Hello! I am a PhD student in Applied Mathematics and Statistics with a concentration in Computational Medicine at Johns Hopkins University, advised by [Dr. Nicolas Charon](http://www.cis.jhu.edu/~charon/). I received a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from Lehigh University in 2021. I am interested in using machine learning and mathematical models to collaboratively solve problems in industry and medicine.
