## Machine Learning and Statistics

**EN.553.796: Random Matrix Theory in Data Science and Statistics** - Johns Hopkins University (Fall 2024) <br>
Random matrix theory is the study of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices with random entries — foundational to high-dimensional statistics and data science. Topics include eigenvalue distributions of specially structured ensembles of random matrices, matrix concentration inequalities, and asymptotic and finite-sample results for broad classes of matrices. A core focus is on probability in high dimensions: concentration of measure, the geometry of high-dimensional spaces and convex sets, Gaussian measure, and sharp transitions and threshold phenomena. Applications will feature principal component analysis, network inference, randomized algorithms, optimization, and neural networks.

**EN.553.650: Computational Molecular Medicine** - Johns Hopkins University (Spring 2022) <br>
Computational systems biology has emerged as the dominant framework for analyzing high-dimensional “omics” data in order to uncover the relationships among molecules, networks and disease. In particular, many of the core methodologies are based on statistical modeling, including machine learning, stochastic processes and statistical inference. We will cover the key aspects of this methodology, including measuring associations, testing multiple hypotheses, and learning predictors, Markov chains and graphical models. In addition, by studying recent important articles in cancer systems biology, we will illustrate how this approach enhances our ability to annotate genomes, discover molecular disease networks, detect disease, predict clinical outcomes, and characterize disease progression.

**EN.580.631: Introduction to Computational Medicine** - Johns Hopkins University (Fall 2021) <br>
Computational medicine is an emerging discipline in which computer models of disease are developed, constrained using data measured from individual patients, and then applied to deliver precision health care. This course will cover computational anatomy. Students will learn how to: model anatomies using magnetic resonance imaging data; compare anatomies via mappings onto anatomical atlases; discover anatomical biomarkers of disease; analyze changes in the connectivity of anatomies in disease.

**HMS 316: Social Epidemiology** - Lehigh University (Fall 2020) <br>
Social epidemiology is the study of the distribution and social determinants of health and disease in human populations. This course introduces the basic principles of epidemiological study design, analysis and interpretation, covering topics such as how a disease spreads across populations and how public health interventions can help control or reduce the spread of disease. This course also reviews epidemiology as a social science by reviewing the social causes and consequences of health.

A control system is a dynamical system on which one can act through a parameter that can be chosen freely at any point in time. In this class, we will be interested in two main problems. The first one is controllability, which studies conditions for the existence of controls allowing an initial point to be driven to any other point. The second one is optimal control, in which we will study methods to minimize a certain cost over all possible controls, possibly with endpoint constraints.
