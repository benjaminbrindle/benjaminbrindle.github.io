**MATH 322: Methods of Applied Analysis I** <br>
Fourier series, eigenfunction expansions, Sturm–Liouville problems, Fourier integrals and their application to partial differential equations; special functions. Emphasis is on a wide variety of formal applications rather than logical development.

**MATH 310: Random Processes and Applications** <br>
Theory and applications of stochastic processes. Limit theorems, introduction to random walks, Markov chains, Poisson processes, birth and death processes, and Brownian motion. Applications to financial mathematics, biology, business and engineering.

**MATH 428: Fields And Modules** <br>
Field theory, including an introduction to Galois theory; the theory of modules, including tensor products and classical algebras.

**MATH 402: Real Analysis II** <br>
Metric spaces; introduction to Banach and Hilbert space theory; Fourier series and Fejer operators; general measure and integration theory, Radon–Nikodym and Riesz representation and theorems; Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral.

**MATH 371: Readings in Mathematical Biology**

**MATH 350: Introduction to Differential Geometry** <br>
Local and global differential geometry of curves and surfaces in Euclidean 3-space; Frenet formulas for curves, regular surfaces, first fundamental form, Gauss map, second fundamental form, curvatures for curves and surfaces and their relations, minimal surfaces, the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, selected special topics and applications, such as hypersurfaces in Euclidean (n+1)-space, Levi-Civita connection, geodesics, parallel transport, Riemannian curvature tensor, etc.

**MATH 316: Complex Analysis** <br>
Concept of analytic function from the points of view of the Cauchy–Riemann equations, power series, complex integration, and conformal mapping.

**MATH 401: Real Analysis I** <br>
Set theory, real numbers; introduction to measures, Lebesgue measure; integration, general convergence theorems; differentiation, functions of bounded variation, absolute continuity; Lp spaces.

**MATH 327: Groups and Rings** <br>
An intensive study of the concepts of group theory including the Sylow theorems, and of ring theory including unique factorization domains and polynomial rings.

**ISE 417: Nonlinear Optimization** <br>
Advanced topics in mathematical optimization with emphasis on modeling and analysis of nonlinear problems. Convex analysis, unconstrained and constrained optimization, duality theory, Lagrangian relaxation, and methods for solving nonlinear optimization problems, including descent methods, Newton methods, conjugate gradient methods, and penalty and barrier methods.

**ISE 365: Applied Data Mining** <br>
Introduction to the data mining process including business problem understanding, data understanding and preparation, modeling and evaluation, and model deployment. Emphasis on hands-on data preparation and modeling using techniques from statistics, artificial intelligence, such as regression, decision trees, neural networks, and clustering. A number of application areas are explored.

**HMS 316: Social Epidemiology** <br>
Social epidemiology is the study of the distribution and social determinants of health and disease in human populations. This course introduces the basic principles of epidemiological study design, analysis and interpretation, covering topics such as how a disease spreads across populations and how public health interventions can help control or reduce the spread of disease. This course also reviews epidemiology as a social science by reviewing the social causes and consequences of health.
